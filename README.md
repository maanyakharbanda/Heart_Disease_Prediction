# Heart_Disease_Prediction
 I'm excited to share with you my latest project, which I prepared to explore my data science skills and as a personal endeavor. This project allowed me to dive deep into the fascinating world of data science. In this project, I focused on Heart Disease Prediction using various models. The main goal was to detect whether the person has a heart disease or not. Dataset used is available on UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project involved various stages, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

# Dataset Description
This dataset includes the following features:

age: The age of the patient.

sex: Gender of the patient (0: female, 1: male).

cp: Type of chest pain.

trestbps: Resting blood pressure.

chol: Serum cholesterol.

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results.

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.

exang: Exercise induced angina.

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest


# Models Implemented are as follows:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
KNN(K- nearest neighbours)
ANN(Artificial Neural Networks)
Ensemble Learning : Gradient Boosting (GBM) , AdaBoost , XGBoost 
Naive Bayes
Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
